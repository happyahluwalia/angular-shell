# AngularShell

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

The plan for this project is to be the shell program to be used in future angular projects. This would be PWA with a quick startup time, service worker, manifest and the whole nine yards :-) Thats the plan.

## Performance
With the basic toolbar and routing option it meets the lighthouse performance requirements.

## ToDo (without impacting performance)
* Add manifest.json for splash screen, theme color, icon etc
* Add service worker logic
* Add lazy loaded modules
